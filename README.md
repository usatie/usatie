Hobby Projects
- Built a [Bash clone](https://github.com/usatie/minishell_v2/) in C and wrote a [detailed guide](https://usatie.notion.site/minishell-29921d3ea13447ad897349acd5733d5e) on incremental, unit-test-driven shell development.
- Developed [Quines](https://github.com/usatie/dr-quine), self-replicating programs that output their own source code.
- Created an [ELF executable packer](https://github.com/usatie/woody_woodpacker) that encrypts and compresses ELF binaries, auto-decrypting at runtime.
- Reimplemented the [nm command](https://github.com/usatie/ft_nm) to analyze ELF binaries and extract symbol table information.
- Built a [Turing Machine Emulator](https://github.com/usatie/ft_turing) to learn OCaml and understand Turing Machine operations.
- Currently reimplementing the [POSIX lex command](https://github.com/usatie/ft_lex) as a preparation for future compiler development.
