About Me
- Worked in Japan (2014–2022); relocated to the United States in 2024
- Master's student in Computer Science at San Francisco State University (Expected graduation: Dec 2025)
- Passionate about systems programming and low-level software development
- Currently exploring high-performance computing and compilers.

🧑‍💼 Professional Work
- Founded [mikan](https://mikan.com) and developed Japan’s most popular (9M+ downloads) English vocabulary app from scratch.
- Maintained [BitcoinKit](https://github.com/yenom/BitcoinKit) (800+ stars), with 345+ contributions across features and fixes.

🎓 Academic Projects
- High-Performance Computing (CSC746) - 99% (A)
  - Used C++, CUDA, MPI, and OpenMP
  - Designed shared-memory parallel programs for multi-core CPU and GPU systems and analyzed performance using runtime, speedup, memory bandwidth, and cache metrics.
  - Conducted various experiments on Perlmutter at NERSC (HPE Cray Shasta platform)

🧪 Hobby / Independent Projects
- Built a [Bash clone](https://github.com/usatie/minishell/) in C and wrote a [detailed guide](https://usatie.notion.site/minishell-29921d3ea13447ad897349acd5733d5e) on incremental, unit-test-driven shell development.
- Developed [Quines](https://github.com/usatie/dr-quine), self-replicating programs that output their own source code.
- Created an [ELF executable packer](https://github.com/usatie/woody_woodpacker) that encrypts and compresses ELF binaries, which automatically decrypts itself at runtime.
- Reimplemented the [nm command](https://github.com/usatie/ft_nm) to analyze ELF binaries and extract symbol table information.
- Built a [Turing Machine Emulator](https://github.com/usatie/ft_turing) to learn OCaml and understand Turing Machine operations.
- Currently building [ugrad](https://github.com/usatie/ugrad), a tiny autograd engine with device backend support, inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad).
